##### An easy way to create custom and complex buttons with custom attributes, directly added to the iOS Interface Builder, very easy to integrate into every project!


## Top 100 Coolest Super Powers:
- [x] Edit everything directly from storyboard or code üòè
- [x] Change border color, width
- [x] Customize the corner radius
- [x] Set a gradient background
- [x] Edit everything about the shadows: color, opacity, offset
- [x] Animations when the button is highlighted ü§ó
- [x] Animations when the button is selected
- [x] Ripple tap effect, where you can edit ripple color and ripple speed (like a Google Material button) üòÆ
- [x] Toggle functionality
- [x] Image View content mode and alpha
- [x] Touch up inside closure ü§†
- [x] Loader ü§úü§õ
- [x] Swift 3, 4 and Swift 5 support
- [x] **and much more**

## How it works
The library allows you to use all the features of standard UIButton with a lot of new cool features, customizable from Storyboard or from code.

</p>

First of all, drag & drop a new UIButton inside your view controller in storyboard, then set the UIButton class to PMSuperButton:

</p>

That's it! Now you are ready to customize your PMSuperButton from the `Attributes Inspector` of Interface Builder.

##### How to use Touch Up Inside closure
IBAction or addTarget() with #selector? No thanks, we have a closure for this:

```
myButton.touchUpInside {
	print("This button was pressed!")
}
```

##### How to show the loader indicator
```
//Pass `false` to disable user interaction while loading is showed
myButton.showLoader(userInteraction: true)

//Hide loader
myButton.hideLoader()
```

## Requirements

- iOS 8.0+
- Xcode 10+

## CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate PMSuperButton into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:


```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

use_frameworks!

pod 'PMSuperButton'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
## Carthage
----------------

[Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) is a decentralized dependency manager that builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

You can install Carthage with [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) using the following command:

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew install carthage
```

To integrate PMSuperButton into your Xcode project using Carthage, specify it in your `Cartfile`:

```ogdl
